TopSecret User Interface
-----

The command-line user interface is the point of entry for the software. The user is able to run the software by providing
up to two arguments, which determine unique feedback from the software. The following use cases are expected.

* No-argument execution: If the user passes no arguments, the software returns an enumeration of the available files.
    >> java TopSecret
        01 filea.txt
        02 fileb.txt
        03 filec.txt

* Single-argument execution: If the user passes exactly one argument, the software returns the contents of the specified
  file (assuming a default deciphering key).
    >> java TopSecret 01
        (Displays to the user the contents of filea.txt)

* Double-argument execution: If the user passes two arguments, the software returns the contents of the specified file
  (first argument) according to a specified deciphering key (second argument).
    >> java TopSecret 01 fghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890abcde
        (Displays to the user the contents of filea.txt deciphered according to the key fghijkl...890abcde)

PSEUDOCODE

if no argument passed:
    retrieve information from Team Member C using some method like getFileList()
    print info to console and terminate
else if one argument passed:
    retrieve file contents from Team Member C using some method like getFileInfo(int fileNumber)
    handle FileNotFoundException if necessary
    print info to console and terminate
else if two arguments passed:
    retrieve deciphered file contents from Team Member C using some method like getFileInfo(int fileNumber, String key)
    handle FileNotFoundException if necessary
    handle InvalidKeyException if necessary
    print info to console and terminate
else:
    Display an error message and terminate
