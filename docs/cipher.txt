Cipher Module Design
_______________________________
Purpose
-------
To implement deciphering for ciphered mission text files. This module accepts a ciphered string and returns readable (deciphered) text.
It supports:
1) A default cipher key stored at ciphers/key.txt
2) An alternate key path supplied as the program's second command-line argument

This module does NOT read mission data files from /data. That is handled by the FileHandler module.

Folder Structure
----------------
Project root:
- ciphers/
    - key.txt (default cipher key)
- data/ (mission text files)

Key File Format (key.txt)
-------------------------
The key file contains exactly two required lines:
1) Plaintext alphabet (the "actual letters")
2) Cipher alphabet (the cipher match for each plaintext letter)

Ex:
Line 1 - ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Line 2 - QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM

Meaning:
If line 1 'A' corresponds to line 2 'Q', then when deciphering we convert 'Q' -> 'A'

Steps
-----
1) Read key file lines:
   plain = line1
   cipher = line2
2) Build a mapping from cipher character to plaintext character:
   cipherToPlain[cipher[i]] = plain[i]
3) For each character ch in the input text:
   - If ch is found in cipherToPlain, replace it with
