TopSecret

This program allows a user to interact with a directory of files by either listing or displaying contents, the latter
of which is deciphered according to a key, whether provided by the user or using the default key given in key.txt.

The point of entry for the program is TopSecret, with a command line user interface. The user may pass up to two additional
arguments, and userinterface.txt explains this interaction in greater detail.
