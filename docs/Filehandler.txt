TopSecret File Handler
----

Thomas Van Pelt (B)


The file handler should expect files in a folder named data (in the same directory of the program, or in the root of your project folder.)
When a request for a file is received, this part of the program will return the file contents.
This part of the program should handle all the direct access to files.


* Goals:
	Read all necessary files
	Return names of the list in the data file
	Send the file to be deciphered
	    give the decipher the default key from the file (only file handler can read files)
	        As a string


*FUNCTION DESCRIPTION:

listFiles()
	Function: When run return the list of file names in the data folder.
		○ Read the file names
		○ Add the file names to an ArrayList<String>
		○ Return the arraylist of names
	Return ArrayList<String>


readKey()
    Function: When run returns the key and corresponding letter in the format:
            abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890
            bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890a
        ○ Read the key file
        ○ Return it at a string
    Return String

readFile(int Index)
	Function: Take in index of file you want to print from the array of names.
		○ Take in file from data folder in root

		○ Send String to decipher function

		○ Return the deciphered string

		Return:
			String

Filehandler
------------------
listFiles(); //arrayList<Strings>
readFile(int indexOfFile); //string
------------------


public  class FileHandler {


private ArrayList<String> NamesOfFiles;

//Called by Member C to return an ArrayList<String> with the
Public ArrayList<String> listFiles(){
	Read the file names from the data folder
	Put one file name string per index

}


//if given index of file it will return the text from inside of that file as a string
Public String readFiles(int Index){

if (validIndex(index)) {

	String textFromFile = Look in NamesOfFiles and file corresponding to the index and save it as text
	String decipheredText = cipher(textFromFile);
	Return decipheredTex;
    }
else {
	Return "Invalid Index"
	}

 }
}
readKey(){
    String key = //read key text from the key file (from the cipher folder on root)
    return key;
}


private boolean validIndex(int index){

	Verify that int is valid

	Compare index to NamesOfFiles's length determine if the index corresponds to a valid file's index

	Return true //if valid
	Return false //if not
}
