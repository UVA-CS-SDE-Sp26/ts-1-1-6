Description of goal:

The goal of this class is to essentially connect the command line to the file handler, request file contents, and return readable text.

When no arguments are input, the user interface should call a function within this class that lists all possible files that can be put in as the input as the following format:
01 filea.txt
02 fileb.txt
03 filec.txt


When 1 argument is passed, it runs a function that returns the contents of the file that the input has the index of using the default deciphering key

When 2 arguments are passed, it runs the same function, but uses the second input as the deciphering key.

Functions this should include:
public String getFileList()
public String handleFileRequest(String fileNumStr, String altKey)


Testing Strategy:
For the getFileList():
Testing if the format of the list displayed is as expected by Pat (starting with 01, 02, 03...) -- using '.startswith('01')' to see if the list started with the correct format

For the handleFileRequest function:
1. Checks if the handleFileRequest returns the expected error if it isn't given a number by passing in 'abc' as the index for the file, and expecting 'Error: Invalid file number.'
2. Tests handleFileRequest with a key, and makes sure that it doesn't return any errors and actually gives an output
3. Tests handleFileRequest without an alternate key(if there is only 1 parameter), and makes sure it returns a valid output

Pseudocode:
task 1: file listing (getfilelist)
- check storage: ask filehandler for all available files
- check status:
    - if no files exist, return "no files found"
    - if files exist, start a loop to format them
- formatting:
    - assign a number to each file (starting at 1)
    - combine the number and filename into a single list string
- result: return the final formatted string

task 2: file processing (handlefilerequest)
- input check:
    - convert the user's input string into an integer
    - subtract 1 from that number to match computer indexing (0-based)
- data retrieval:
    - fetch the content from the filehandler using the index
    - if the index is invalid, return the error message
- key selection:
    - if an override key (altKey) is provided, use it
    - if no override exists, pull the default key from the handler
- decryption:
    - send the file content and the chosen key to the cipher
    - return the final decrypted result
-errors
    - catch errors and return
